The pbix and xlsx files for basic DAX are in this folder as well as the power query scripts.  Download both files to your desktop or documents folder. 

We will only be using the pbix file but the xlsx file has all the source data in case you want to go back later and change some things.  Be aware that if you choose Edit Queries, you will get an error and have to browse to where the xlsx file is located.  Parts of the data load may also fail, I have this happen sometimes when someone downloads files to their machine and has to browse to them.  I would recommend making a backup copy of the original file prior to editing the queries.  That way you have an untouched copy of the power query scripts accessible through the Advanced Editor that you can use to recreate the original query if you have problems.
