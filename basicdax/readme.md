The pbix and xlsx files for basic DAX are in this folder as well as the power query scripts.  Download both files to your desktop or documents folder. 

We will only be using the pbix file but the xlsx file has all the source data in case you want to go back later and change some things.  Be aware that if you choose Edit Queries, you will get an error and have to browse to where the xlsx file is located.  Parts of the data load may also fail, I have seen this happen sometimes when someone downloads files to their machine and has to browse to them.  I would recommend making a backup copy of the original file prior to editing the queries.  That way you have an untouched copy of the power query scripts accessible through the Advanced Editor that you can use to recreate the original query if you have problems.

Recommended websites for DAX -

  sqibi.com - Mostly a blog, but the posts and articles are fantastic. If I have a question and go to this site, more often than
  not something on the front page will be relevant.
  
  daxpatterns.com - Sister site to sqlbi.com.  Goes over commonly used patterns.  Each pattern is fully explained through an example that   gets more progressively more complicated.  The best part is you don't have to use the more complicated parts of the patterns.
  
  daxguide.com - Rencently launched DAX reference.  It's mostly a function reference but it's much easier to navigate than the official     Microsoft documentation.
  
  daxformatter.com - Allows you to copy and paste a DAX function you've written into the page.  It will return the best way to format it     for readability as well as flag any mistakes in the syntax such as missing commas, parenthesis, etc.  Please note it won't be able to    tell you if your function will work for your particular report though.
  
All the above websites are run by Russo and Ferrari, two of the most recognized experts in SSAS/Power Pivot/DAX/Excel.  Rob Collie also has a good site called Power Pivot Pro but it may be confusing to beginners because it concentrates on using DAX in Excel which can take some getting used to if you're not already familiar with it.
